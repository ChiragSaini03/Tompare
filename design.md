Main Upload a request will contain UI for adding images with add image feature with limit of 6 images to be added.
Now each image will added will have local parts of edits, dehazing, coloring, etc. on its image parent div.
Then we will have publish requst button for the same.

For a user perspective, we can have divs 

Then there must be a bidding logic for the request so as how much amount to be paid and how to pay it.




For contribution
we will have a list of all requests and user can click and vote on mini windows for voting and after that we will have that request as already done.
and for each user we can store the ids of request already submitted then mark them as green and rest as white already.
